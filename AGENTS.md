# 注意事项

## 一、基础规则

- 必须使用中文回复
- 默认使用 PHP 8.5 新特性
- 遵循 SOLID
- 代码必须：可测试、可维护、可扩展
- 禁止过度设计

---

## 二、架构约束

### Controller（必须薄）

只允许：

- 接收参数
- 调用 Action
- 返回响应

禁止：

- 写业务逻辑
- 直接操作 Model
- 组合多个 Action

示例：

```php
public function store(
    StorePostRequest $request,
    SavePostAction $action
) {
    return response()->json(
        $action->execute($request->validated())
    );
}
```

---

### Action（唯一业务层）

- 所有业务逻辑必须在 `app/Actions`
- 每个 Action 单一职责
- 必须 final
- 必须构造函数注入
- 统一暴露 `execute()` 方法
- 禁止 static 业务方法

示例：

```php
final class SaveTemporaryMediaAction
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly MediaRepository $repository,
    ) {}

    public function execute(UploadedFile $file): Media
    {
        return $this->repository->store($file);
    }
}
```

---

## 强制 TDD

必须遵循：

### Red

- 先写失败测试

### Green

- 写最少代码通过测试

### Refactor

- 消除重复
- 优化结构
- 保证测试通过

禁止先写实现。

---

## 代码质量规则

必须优先使用：

- readonly
- Enum（禁止魔法字符串）
- Match
- 强类型返回
- Constructor Property Promotion

限制：

- 方法 ≤ 20 行
- 嵌套 ≤ 3 层
- 单一职责
- 禁止隐式副作用

---

## 测试规则

- Action → Unit Test
- Controller → Feature Test
- 每个测试只验证一个行为
- 命名表达业务语义

示例：

```php
it('stores temporary media successfully');
```

---

## 核心优先级

1. 可测试性
2. 可读性
3. 明确性
4. 简洁性
5. 性能优化最后考虑

# Laravel & PHP Guidelines for AI Code Assistants

This file contains Laravel and PHP coding standards optimized for AI code assistants like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. These guidelines are derived from Spatie's comprehensive Laravel & PHP standards.

## Core Laravel Principle

**Follow Laravel conventions first.** If Laravel has a documented way to do something, use it. Only deviate when you have a clear justification.

## PHP Standards

- Follow PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-12
- Use camelCase for non-public-facing strings
- Use short nullable notation: `?string` not `string|null`
- Always specify `void` return types when methods return nothing

## Class Structure

- Use typed properties, not docblocks:
- Constructor property promotion when all properties can be promoted:
- One trait per line:

## Type Declarations & Docblocks

- Use typed properties over docblocks
- Specify return types including `void`
- Use short nullable syntax: `?Type` not `Type|null`
- Document iterables with generics:
  ```php
  /** @return Collection<int, User> */
  public function getUsers(): Collection
  ```

### Docblock Rules

- Don't use docblocks for fully type-hinted methods (unless description needed)
- **Always import classnames in docblocks** - never use fully qualified names:
  ```php
  use \Spatie\Url\Url;
  /** @return Url */
  ```
- Use one-line docblocks when possible: `/** @var string */`
- Most common type should be first in multi-type docblocks:
  ```php
  /** @var Collection|SomeWeirdVendor\Collection */
  ```
- If one parameter needs docblock, add docblocks for all parameters
- For iterables, always specify key and value types:
  ```php
  /**
   * @param array<int, MyObject> $myArray
   * @param int $typedArgument 
   */
  function someFunction(array $myArray, int $typedArgument) {}
  ```
- Use array shape notation for fixed keys, put each key on it's own line:
  ```php
  /** @return array{
     first: SomeClass, 
     second: SomeClass
  } */
  ```

## Control Flow

- **Happy path last**: Handle error conditions first, success case last
- **Avoid else**: Use early returns instead of nested conditions
- **Separate conditions**: Prefer multiple if statements over compound conditions
- **Always use curly brackets** even for single statements
- **Ternary operators**: Each part on own line unless very short

```php
// Happy path last
if (! $user) {
    return null;
}

if (! $user->isActive()) {
    return null;
}

// Process active user...

// Short ternary
$name = $isFoo ? 'foo' : 'bar';

// Multi-line ternary
$result = $object instanceof Model ?
    $object->name :
    'A default value';

// Ternary instead of else
$condition
    ? $this->doSomething()
    : $this->doSomethingElse();
```

## Laravel Conventions

### Routes

- URLs: kebab-case (`/open-source`)
- Route names: camelCase (`->name('openSource')`)
- Parameters: camelCase (`{userId}`)
- Use tuple notation: `[Controller::class, 'method']`

### Controllers

- Plural resource names (`PostsController`)
- Stick to CRUD methods (`index`, `create`, `store`, `show`, `edit`, `update`, `destroy`)
- Extract new controllers for non-CRUD actions

### Configuration

- Files: kebab-case (`pdf-generator.php`)
- Keys: snake_case (`chrome_path`)
- Add service configs to `config/services.php`, don't create new files
- Use `config()` helper, avoid `env()` outside config files

### Artisan Commands

- Names: kebab-case (`delete-old-records`)
- Always provide feedback (`$this->comment('All ok!')`)
- Show progress for loops, summary at end
- Put output BEFORE processing item (easier debugging):
  ```php
  $items->each(function(Item $item) {
      $this->info("Processing item id `{$item->id}`...");
      $this->processItem($item);
  });
  
  $this->comment("Processed {$items->count()} items.");
  ```

## Strings & Formatting

- **String interpolation** over concatenation:

## Enums

- Use PascalCase for enum values:

## Comments

Be very critical about adding comments as they often become outdated and can mislead over time. Code should be self-documenting through descriptive variable and function names.

Adding comments should never be the first tactic to make code readable.

*Instead of this:*
```php
// Get the failed checks for this site
$checks = $site->checks()->where('status', 'failed')->get();
```

*Do this:*
```php
$failedChecks = $site->checks()->where('status', 'failed')->get();
```

**Guidelines:**
- Don't add comments that describe what the code does - make the code describe itself
- Short, readable code doesn't need comments explaining it
- Use descriptive variable names instead of generic names + comments
- Only add comments when explaining *why* something non-obvious is done, not *what* is being done
- Never add comments to tests - test names should be descriptive enough

## Whitespace

- Add blank lines between statements for readability
- Exception: sequences of equivalent single-line operations
- No extra empty lines between `{}` brackets
- Let code "breathe" - avoid cramped formatting

## Validation

- Use array notation for multiple rules (easier for custom rule classes):
  ```php
  public function rules() {
      return [
          'email' => ['required', 'email'],
      ];
  }
  ```
- Custom validation rules use snake_case:
  ```php
  Validator::extend('organisation_type', function ($attribute, $value) {
      return OrganisationType::isValid($value);
  });
  ```

## Authorization

- Policies use camelCase: `Gate::define('editPost', ...)`
- Use CRUD words, but `view` instead of `show`

## Translations

- Use `__()` function over `@lang`:

## API Routing

- Use plural resource names: `/errors`
- Use kebab-case: `/error-occurrences`
- Limit deep nesting for simplicity:
  ```
  /error-occurrences/1
  /errors/1/occurrences
  ```

## Testing

- Keep test classes in same file when possible
- Use descriptive test method names
- Follow the arrange-act-assert pattern

## Quick Reference

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes**: PascalCase (`UserController`, `OrderStatus`)
- **Methods/Variables**: camelCase (`getUserName`, `$firstName`)
- **Routes**: kebab-case (`/open-source`, `/user-profile`)
- **Config files**: kebab-case (`pdf-generator.php`)
- **Config keys**: snake_case (`chrome_path`)
- **Artisan commands**: kebab-case (`php artisan delete-old-records`)

### File Structure

- Controllers: plural resource name + `Controller` (`PostsController`)
- Views: camelCase (`openSource.blade.php`)
- Jobs: action-based (`CreateUser`, `SendEmailNotification`)
- Events: tense-based (`UserRegistering`, `UserRegistered`)
- Listeners: action + `Listener` suffix (`SendInvitationMailListener`)
- Commands: action + `Command` suffix (`PublishScheduledPostsCommand`)
- Mailables: purpose + `Mail` suffix (`AccountActivatedMail`)
- Resources/Transformers: plural + `Resource`/`Transformer` (`UsersResource`)
- Enums: descriptive name, no prefix (`OrderStatus`, `BookingType`)

### Migrations

- do not write down methods in migrations, only up methods

### Code Quality Reminders

#### PHP

- Use typed properties over docblocks
- Prefer early returns over nested if/else
- Use constructor property promotion when all properties can be promoted
- Avoid `else` statements when possible
- Use string interpolation over concatenation
- Always use curly braces for control structures

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to ensure the best experience when building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.5.2
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/horizon (HORIZON) - v5
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- laravel/boost (BOOST) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pail (PAIL) - v1
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `pest-testing` — Tests applications using the Pest 4 PHP framework. Activates when writing tests, creating unit or feature tests, adding assertions, testing Livewire components, browser testing, debugging test failures, working with datasets or mocking; or when the user mentions test, spec, TDD, expects, assertion, coverage, or needs to verify functionality works.
- `laravel-permission-development` — Build and work with Spatie Laravel Permission features, including roles, permissions, middleware, policies, teams, and Blade directives.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double-check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user, you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain/IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.
- Use the `database-schema` tool to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before trying other approaches when working with Laravel or Laravel ecosystem packages. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic-based queries at once. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. The most relevant results will be returned first.
- Do not add package names to queries; package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'.
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit".
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - words must be adjacent and in that order.
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit".
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms.

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.

## Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters unless the constructor is private.

## Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<!-- Explicit Return Types and Method Params -->
```php
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
```

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless the logic is exceptionally complex.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions when appropriate.

=== herd rules ===

# Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: `https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test`. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate valid URLs for the user.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(S). It is always available through Laravel Herd.

=== tests rules ===

# Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test --compact` with a specific filename or filter.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

## Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries.
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

## Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

## Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

# Laravel 12

- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Laravel documentation and updated code examples.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

## Laravel 12 Structure

- In Laravel 12, middleware are no longer registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`.
- Middleware are configured declaratively in `bootstrap/app.php` using `Application::configure()->withMiddleware()`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- The `app\Console\Kernel.php` file no longer exists; use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- Console commands in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

## Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 12 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.
- CRITICAL: ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Pest documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `pest-testing` every time you're working with a Pest or testing-related task.
